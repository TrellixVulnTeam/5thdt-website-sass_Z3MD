                    5th Dimension Technologies - The name raised many eyebrows.
                    People were curious to know why this name was chosen.
                    Whenever this question was put to our founder President
                    Rajiv Sharma he would explain with utmost patience. Yes, we
                    are 5thDT.

                  <p class="paragraph">
                    We had our ouch moments many a times because lot many used
                    to have their own version of our company name. 5D, 5thD,
                    5DT, 5Dimension and what not. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are
                    5thDT.
